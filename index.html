                Apart from its association with <strong>Slash, Joe Bonamassa,</strong> and various other high-profile users, the main reason why our amps are so sought after is their sound. We're pleased to report that the reissue amp is tonally as accurate as it possibly could be, with perhaps a touch more gain and low-end punch than the original. The amps accurately reproduces the original tone - and with a few minor exceptions, the look - of the original, at a price that's very reasonable compared with the competition, especially for a UK-made product.

                    I've always played every amp I've ever had full up, because rock and roll is supposed to be played <strong>loud</strong>. Also, that's how you get your sustain.

            <h2 class="features__title">Practical</h2>
            <p class="features__description">
                Only our guitar amplifiers are the all-time classic gigging and recording amps, in this new incarnation the amps is arguably more practical than ever, thanks to the extra versatility offered by being able to utilise the tremolo and reverb on both channels.<br>
                The our amps looks familiar, but practically every detail has been worked on and sweated over. The control panel has separate channels for clean and overdrive, with two footswitchable voices on each channel. There’s also a new, low-power option, which reduces output from around 40 watts down to just four watts. Global controls include a master volume and level control for the Club’s built-in digital reverb. On the rear panel, you’ll find extension speaker outlets and an effects loop, with new features including a USB recording output together with speaker-emulated line outs on jack and XLR.
